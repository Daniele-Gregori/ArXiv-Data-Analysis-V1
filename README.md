Text analysis of theoretical high energy physics papers on arXiv (with hep-th as primary or cross list category) from 1986 to 2023. Exploration of the following possible tasks: 1) counting; 2) clustering; 3) classification; 4) question answering; 5) summarising; 6) recommending papers/research directions.
Results: 
	1) interesting temporal trends appear in title words popularity;
	2)  2-words title concepts allows effective NN embedding and clustering of abstracts;
	3) it looks sensible to build a ML classifier even among hep-th mixed categories;
	4) effective answering of field-specific questions by feeding article introductions into high level AI/LLM functionality;
	5) similar possibility of articles summarization.
In perspective it looks possible to relate papers in concept feature space and thus inspire new discoveries.
